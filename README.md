# AgeCalulator

This is a very simple project that I developed to get a rudimentary grasp on the basics of kotlin and Android apps.

It simply uses a DateDialog to allow you to select the date, which it then calculates what your age would be in minutes and in days
and promptly displays them on the screen.

Maybe it could be made more interesting by inserting interesting facts instead such as:
"6 presidents have served during your lifetime" etc.
